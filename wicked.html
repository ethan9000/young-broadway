			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Wicked, the Broadway sensation, looks at what happened in the Land of Oz…but from a different angle. Long before Dorothy arrives, there is another girl, born with emerald-green skin—smart, fiery, misunderstood, and possessing an extraordinary talent. When she meets a bubbly blonde who is exceptionally popular, their initial rivalry turns into the unlikeliest of friendships…until the world decides to call one “good,” and the other one “wicked.” With a thrilling score that includes the hits “Defying Gravity,” “Popular” and “For Good,” Wicked has been hailed by The New York Times as “the defining musical of the decade.” Time Magazine cheers, “if every musical had the brain, the heart, and the courage of Wicked, Broadway really would be a magical place.” The Gershwin Theatre on 50th Street and Broadway is that magical place. From the first electrifying note to the final breathtaking moment, Wicked—the untold true story of the Witches of Oz—transfixes audiences with its wildly inventive story. It will send your spirits soaring to heights you’ll never forget.</p>

			<h2>Parent Information </h2>
			<p>The Wicked box office advises that the show isn’t suitable for children under the age of 7, and those under 3 will not be allowed in to the theatre. There’s no bad language, stark violence or overt sexual activity. But there are some scary moments – and some sad moments. A couple of the creatures – the winged dragon and flying monkey – might feel a bit threatening, while the Wizard of Oz’s head is powerfully overbearing. There are also upsetting moments when some of the animals are badly treated. Plus the ending has caused some audience members to get out the hankies. If you know your child is sensitive and scared by loud, unexpected noises, then this is not the show for them. At our performance, the children in the audience were clearly loving the theatrical spectacle. I did see several under 7s, including some who looked as young as 4. None of them cried or shrieked and while some did end up on their parents’ laps, they all managed to keep their attention on the performance.</p>
