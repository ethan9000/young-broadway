			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man who brought rock and romance to Broadway, is back with a new heart-stirring hit. SCHOOL OF ROCK is a New York Times Critics’ Pick and “AN INSPIRING JOLT OF ENERGY, JOY AND MAD SKILLZ!” (Entertainment Weekly ). Reuters raves ”ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER HAS BROADWAY ROCKING AGAIN!”</p>

			<p>Based on the hit film, this hilarious new musical follows Dewey Finn, a failed, wannabe rock star who decides to earn a few extra bucks by posing as a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. There he turns a class of straight-A students into a guitar-shredding, bass-slapping, mind-blowing rock band. While teaching these pint-sized prodigies what it means to truly rock, Dewey falls for the school’s beautiful, but uptight headmistress, helping her rediscover the wild child within. (The New York Times says, “BE WARNED! There’s a love story in this one.”)</p>

			<p>Featuring 14 new songs from Andrew Lloyd Webber and all the original songs from the movie, this high-octane smash delivers face-melting guitar riffs and touching romance in equally awesome doses! The Daily News cheers, ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER “AWAKENS THE EMPOWERING MESSAGE OF ROCK!” and Time Out New York raves, “SCHOOL’s in – FOREVER!”</p>

			<h2>Parent Information </h2>
			<p>I had doubts going into this musical based on the Jack Black movie of the same name. The film, about a wannabe music star teaching a bunch of private school kids to rock under false pretenses, was practically perfect and relied on classic songs. I could not imagine Andrew Lloyd Webber, of The Phantom of the Opera and Cats fame, would write such convincing tunes. Like most critics, I left joyfully banging my head. The lead is adorable and energetic, putting his own stamp on the role. Meanwhile, the kids, all real-life musicians and Broadway neophytes, are spectacular. It's inspiring to watch these tykes rock out! Note: Although the recommended minimum age is 8, there's a bit of cursing and plenty of defying authority.</p>
