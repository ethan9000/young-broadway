			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Inspired by the beloved films, Anastasia  transports us from the twilight of the Russian Empire to the euphoria of Paris in the 1920s, as a brave young woman sets out to discover the mystery of her past. Pursued by a ruthless Soviet officer determined to silence her, Anya enlists the aid of a dashing conman and a lovable ex-aristocrat. Together, they embark on an epic adventure to help her find home, love, and family.</p>

			<h2>Parent Information </h2>
			<p>it's inspired by a legend that was recently disproved making it historically inaccurate, and some of the action takes place against the bloody backdrop of the Russian Revolution. However, the scary parts of the story (like the assassination of Anastasia's entire family) are handled so subtly, little kids probably won't quite get what's going on (7 is the official recommended minimum age). At its heart, it's about finding yourself, as Anastasia journeys from St. Petersburg to Paris with a pair of con men to try to convince her grandmother that she's the real deal. Along the way there's plenty of romance and absolutely stunning visuals thanks to breathtaking costumes and immersive projections which conjure the lavish locales. Fans of the film should note that the story has been significantly altered: Rasputin and Bartok are gone and there's a new Javert-from-Les Mis-style villain named Gleb. However, six of the movie's songs, including the Oscar-nominated "Journey to the Past" remain alongside more than a dozen new pop-heavy numbers.</p>
