			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Cady Heron may have grown up on an African savanna, but nothing prepared her for the wild and vicious ways of her strange new home: suburban Illinois. How will this naïve newbie rise to the top of the popularity pecking order? By taking on The Plastics, a trio of lionized frenemies led by the charming but ruthless Regina George. But, when Cady devises a plan to end Regina’s reign, she learns the hard way that you can’t cross a Queen Bee without getting stung.</p>

			<h2>Parent Information </h2>
			<p>It may be a cliche to say that the stage adaptation of Tina Fey's classic comedy Mean Girls is totally fetch, but it's accurate. The high-energy musical follows the movie closely, often verbatim, but the pop-rock songs give added insight into the characters' emotional lives as smart new girl Cady tries to navigate the hierarchy at her high school, which is ruled by the vicious Regina George and her Plastics. The recommended minimum age is 12 and that sounds right since there's a lot of bitchiness and some pretty raunchy sex jokes. However, like the source material, the show has an uplifting moral: even "mean girls" are human. My 12-year-old daughter said this was her favorite Broadway show of the season, hands down. As a fellow mathlete, Cady is her shero.</p>
